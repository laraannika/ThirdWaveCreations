                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to ThreeWaveCreations, where passion for web development meets innovation and collaboration. We are a team of three dedicated web developers who came together to turn our shared vision into reality. Our journey began during an intensive year-long online training program at the Digital Career Institute (DCI), where our paths crossed and our individual aspirations intertwined.

                <p>
                    <span>How We Met:</span>
                    Our story is one of serendipity and shared ambition. As we navigated the challenges and triumphs of our DCI training, we quickly realized that our skills complemented each other perfectly. Late-night coding sessions, collaborative projects, and countless hours of problem-solving fostered a deep bond and a mutual respect for each other's abilities. This connection laid the foundation for what would eventually become ThreeWaveCreations.
